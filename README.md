# DreamCraft

**A Decentralized Creative Platform for Digital Content Monetization**

DreamCraft is a revolutionary blockchain-powered platform designed to empower digital creators. It provides a fair, transparent, and decentralized ecosystem where creators retain full ownership of their content, earn points through engagement, and convert those points into tradable tokens. DreamCraft eliminates intermediaries and puts creators in control of their intellectual property and monetization.

## üîÑ Data Flow & Implementation Logic

### 1. Content Creation & Upload

- Users upload digital content (art, music, video, writing) via the frontend.
- Files are stored on IPFS, generating a unique content hash.
- Metadata and hash are registered on-chain via smart contracts.

### 2. User Engagement & Points System

- Users interact with content (likes, views, shares, comments).
- Engagement is tracked by the backend and used to calculate reward points.
- AI algorithms ensure fair engagement scoring and anti-manipulation.

### 3. Points-to-Token Conversion

- Creators can convert accumulated points into platform tokens.
- Conversion rates are determined dynamically based on market and performance metrics.
- Smart contracts handle conversion and issuance securely.

### 4. Revenue & Reward Distribution

- Tokens are distributed directly to creators based on content performance.
- No intermediaries: all transactions are executed via smart contracts.
- High-performing creators earn more tokens and exposure.

### 5. Community Governance

- Token holders can participate in governance votes.
- Topics include platform upgrades, reward models, moderation policies, etc.
- Governance smart contracts ensure secure and tamper-proof decision-making.
